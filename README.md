# Lid Driven Cavity PINN

This code was written together with Mr. Jiang Qinghua and Dr. Shu Chang of the National University of Singapore, in partial fulfilment of my Final Year Project.

For the project, I compare two ML approaches to modelling a lid-driven cavity flow. The first is a data-driven multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, which is a naive black-box function approximation of the true underlying process. The second is a physics-inferred neural net- work (PINN), which incorporates the Navierâ€“Stokes equations into the loss function for training.

It is shown that the PINN allows for qualitatively and quantitatively better recovery of the fluid flow in low-data regimes. With more data, the improvements of the PINN compared to the MLP decrease.

The PINN also allows essentially unsupervised training when set up correctly; in the scope of the project, we recover the pressure field qualitatively without including any pressure training points. When one pressure point is included in training, the field is quantitatively accurately predicted.
